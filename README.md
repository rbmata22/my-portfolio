### Projects
#### Grade Calculator

Initial Project Idea
- I had to make a calculator that could calculate a grade in a class given all fo the assignment grades and their points. I set out to solve the problem of not being able to know exactly what a grade in a certain class may be. Sometimes professors will not post a total grade of the whole course so having your own calculator to figure that out is very helpful.

Tools I Used
- Microsoft Excel 

Challenges I Faced
- Outside of figuring out how I wanted to design it, one of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out the correct formulas for each grade. Discerning points and percentages from each other, as well as trying to figure out how to get the letter grade to show accurately.

Other Resources
- None

Result:
- I set out to create a grade calculator and successfully done so given that the user inputs their grades and assignment properly.
- If I could improve it, I would definitely implement a target grade calculator to see what a final exam would need to be graded in order to reach a desired overall grade.

Summary
- This grade calculator can take in assignments, quizzes, projects, anything that has a grade and calculate the overall grade of them with the weight of each input as well. It is very helpful in seeing how points and weights attribute to final grades and seeing the letter grade in a class. Overall, this project was very fun and applicable to me since I am a student.

#### Income Tracker

Initial Project Idea 
- I was assigned a task to track total income based on various different factors. Thus, I decided on utilizing the most important metrics in terms of income and also common ways people spend money in order to solve the problem of tracking income and profit over time. By inputting various costs, expenses, income, and salary the tracker will automatically calculate the both the total of expenses and income.

Tools I Used
- Microsoft Excel

Challenges I Faced
- I found calculating the totals of everything very tedious, as well as trying to figure out the formulas for each tab.

Other Resources
- None

Result
- I set out to create an income tracker that can calculate the total profit based on expenses and income. This project was successful as the outputs are all accurate and tested based on given inputs for income, expenses, savings, etc. If I could go back and improve upon this project I would definitely try to add more for savings and a formula to calculate how much would need to be saved over a given amount of time to reach a certain money goal.

Summary
- This income tracker allows users to input their expenses, income, and savings in order to calculate their overall profit/revenue based on these inputs. It can also act as a tracker for savings and keep tabs on different expenses.

#### Reselling Videogame Consoles Side Hustle
![Image](/images/Screenshot%202025-04-24%20144453.png)
Initial Project Idea 
- I had been tasked to think of a side hustle and try to create a tracker for it. Thus, I like videogames and knew that people often resell videogame consoles. Thus, I decided to create this tracker for different consoles and display all kinds of information for it.
- I know that reselling as a side hustle requires a lot of number crunching and logistics. Thus, being able to track consoles, their prices, how much they resell for, calculating profits, and many more would be very beneficial in making this a stable side hustle.

Tools I Used 
- Microsoft Excel

Challenges I Faced
- The hardest part was finding accurate prices for each videogame console as the market is constantly fluctuating.
- Another difficulty I faced was figuring out how to make different formulas for profits and profit margins.

Other Resources
- None

Result
- I set out to make a tracker and organizer for reselling videogame consoles and I believe that this fully accomplishes that. Not only does it include the consoles and their pricing, both retail and resell, but also the amount of potential profit that could be made and indicating to the user whether or not they would make a good profit margin.
- I would definitely go back and improve upon the profits by adding whether or not certain consoles have a high likelihood of increasing in value over time. 

Summary:
- This project is both a tracker for videogame console prices and a calculator for determining profits and average prices for resellers. When taking on a side hustle like reselling, it is important to keep track of prices and make accurate choices on whether or not it would be profitable to invest in certain videogame consoles. I enjoyed working on this project as I like to play videogames from time to time, so looking at the prices of certain consoles and doing research on them was cool.
